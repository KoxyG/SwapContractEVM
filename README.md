# AdvancedTokenSwap 

- The AdvancedTokenSwap is a Solidity smart contract that facilitates the deposit and exchange of ERC20 tokens in a trustless and decentralized manner. Users can deposit tokens and specify allowed tokens for purchase. The contract supports token swaps with specified amounts and ensures that users can withdraw their deposits if needed.

The contract leverages OpenZeppelinâ€™s SafeERC20 for secure token operations and ReentrancyGuard to prevent reentrancy attacks.
